This article talks about the use of loading indicators for web pages. Even though we have not covered this in class, it was still a nice and usefull article. Many websites have loading indicators, some of which are not as aparent or identifiable. This website covers the code for multiple loading indicators you could use on a web page. They range from simple and small to big and fancy. I liked the ease of use with this website. The code was provided and was easy to implement. I could see the loading indicator right away on my webpage. One thing i would like to know more on is how to have the indicator only appear when something is actually loading.
